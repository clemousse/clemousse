### Hello ! I'm Clémentine Chasles.
This is my github !

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a software engineer (full-stack developement) at **Ada Tech School**.
- ❤️ I'm mostly interested in back/full-stack development because I like to manipulate APIs, datas, servers and so on, solve problems on these topics and make the links with the front. It allows me to understand a whole project and to be polyvalent on it.
- 💻 You'll find on my github the projects we realized at school, with my teamates :
    - coding a video game on Pico 8 👉 kitties like fishies, a retro 2D game where cats eat fish, while avoiding dogs.
    - coding a responsive website with datavizualisation 👉 to visualize in a dynamic way the position and the trajectory of the International Space Station.
    - coding an extension for Chrome 👉 to see in one click the events and activities of the month in Paris, filtered by categories.
    - optimizing a social network 👉 to allow users to share around the environmental issue.
    - coding an e-commerce website 👉 to allow customers to purchase furnitures online in a secure way.
    - coding a microblog 👉 to allow users to post around babies.
- 🔍 I'm looking for an apprenticeship of one year from october 2023.
